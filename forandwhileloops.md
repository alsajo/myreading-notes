# For and While Loops

#### Logical Operators

##### && (Logical And Command)
Tests more than one condition
Ex:
If BOTH expressions evaluate to true then expression runs true
If one returns fals then expression returns false
##### || (Logical Or Command)
Tests @ least one condition
If EITHER expression evaluates to true then the expression returns true
If both return false then the expression returns false
##### ! (Logical Not Command)
Reverses the state of an expression - if false (without ! before it) it will return true and vice versa.
!true = false
!false = true


#### For (Command Loop)
Run Code Specific Number of Times

#### While (Command Loop)
the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true

#### Do...While (Command Loop)
Similar to While loop but will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false


##### Loop Counters
- [x] Initialization
Create a variable and set it to a number
Ex: var i = 0;
- [x] Condition
Loop should continue to run until counter reaches  a specified number
Ex: i < 10;
- [x] Update
Everytime the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter
Ex: i++
- [ ] 
_Do **not** compare yourself to others. You are exactly where you need to be._
